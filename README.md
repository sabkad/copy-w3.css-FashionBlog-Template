# copy-w3.css-FashionBlog-Template

This website was built for educational purposes only.
The design was taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">W3.CSS Website Templates</a> tutorial. 

Link to the original Demo:

Results: 
1. This website has several entries with each having a comment section which shows up and hides when clicking the "Replies" button. 
   For me it was a challange to find a way to show/hide a comment section of the one chosen entry. It was weird to add event listeners for each object, of course. 
   So eventually I ended up with one trivial solution in which I'm not sure. But it worked. So lets leave it that way for now. 
2. Clicking the Like button on the original demo changes its content from "Like" to "Liked", however, it is impossible to cancel your action.
   I made up some dubious script, and God knows is it legal to make it that way.
3. I still can't make an absolute copy of a design. It always has some tiny differences. 
4. I think I relatively improved my code organization. It definitely looks more understandable. I hope..
